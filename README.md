IronmanSurvival
===============

Hard and atractive survival modification based on Paul Soares Jr Man vs Minecraft series.



Ideas:
- proper tool for the right job
- remove wooden tools
- deadly hunger (you must eat X times a day/once per X days)
- no placeable torches
- carry torches for light
- carry torches burn down
- carry torches go off in the watter
- no light source at night or any other dark space = blindness
- change mob drops -> more like in beta
- you must drink water
- digging, walking, swimming causes fatigue
- backpack
- flint laying all around the world (to make stone axes!)
- number of X life's
- graveyards
- grave spawn when you die, if you visited a graveyard you'll re spawn there and become a ghost
- as a ghost you have ~2 days to find your grave or you die
- each item has weight
- you have a max carry weight
